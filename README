This is an attempt to unify various video players apis

Vimeo and YouTube are the obvious ones and while testing and developing one
needs an internet connection for it to work. For other player like JWPlayer
you need your own hosted streaming video if you want to be able to seek into
the video and what not. For testing purposes you can simply just host that
file as well.

For the flash players to work the files need to be served from a web server
running it from the local file system is not sufficient. For convenience I
have included a super simple sinatra script that should do the trick ...
install sinatra gem

run ruby script/server.rb 
and navigate to localhost:4567
